# Autto-Kleeker
A basic Autoclicker I built for a friend with an over-complicated backend.

**Built with AHK v1**

## Features
- Supports up to 10 click speeds including 9 with customizable delays.
- Configuration Gui to allow users to change speeds and basic options
- A suspend feature to enable/disable autoclicks

### Known issues / Planned features
- Currently all hotkeys are hardcoded into the script.
  - Future versions would allow users to customize the hotkeys
- No type safety or validation for updated settings. Shouldn't be a major issue but it's probably best to keep numbers positive and avoiding other characters where there should be numbers
  - This could be done but it would take a minute, this may be in future updates.
- GUI is a bit ugly, since it was cobbled together so quickly it could probably use some polish. 

## About
A friend asked if I knew of a good auto clicker. I asked them what they needed and whipped this up in an hour as a demonstration of AHK and to see if I could interest them in learning to write scripts. 

The back-end is over complicated and the code is less intended to be consistent and more intended to give examples of AHK at different levels as well as to demonstrate some key features when working with control flow and GUI's.

Though an experiment, this is perfectly functional and I encourage anyone interested to make their own iterations or use this as a starting point for your own project.
